# Placemaking analysis

Analysis of the place making sessions during the discussions of the project opening Wake up! Cities https://cisr-berlin.org/wakeupcities

Here we include analysis of:

1. speech to text transformation (run it in colab if needed)
2. sentiment analysis 
3. topic modeling of the text 
4. statistical text analysis

The main motivation behind analysis of placemaking events is to 
answer the questions: "What are succesfull placemaking activities? How to disentangle those activities into phases for better understanding and facilitation of outcomes?"
