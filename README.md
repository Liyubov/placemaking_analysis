# Placemaking analysis

Analysis of the place making sessions during the discussions of the project opening Wake up! Cities https://cisr-berlin.org/wakeupcities
Other examples of such projects include but are not limited to https://participedia.net/case/63 

Here we include analysis of:

1. speech to text transformation (run it in colab if needed)
2. sentiment analysis 
3. topic modeling of the text 
4. statistical text analysis

## Motivation 
The main motivation behind analysis of placemaking events is to 
answer the questions: "What are succesfull placemaking activities? How to disentangle those activities into phases for better understanding and facilitation of outcomes?" 


Often place-making activities are quite demanding in documenting and sense-making. 
Hence one needs to make sure they are assisted in a relevant and correct way within the ethical AI framework.
