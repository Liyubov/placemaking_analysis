            " 2012 I knocked on the door of the slaughterhouse with an idea You remember the second slide I showed? Like this massive slaughterhouse and then They were talking about it in the media About how they went to two key jobs in that space Because it's very important, it's very poor neighbourhood People are very educated so keeping jobs that are for football There was very important so they created a kind of master plan To protect their side against the projected workers That were building lofts all along the canal Which is a new place to be in Brussels And actually it was perceived really well And so it was very good jobs It's good but what about the space? The space can be more than just something where people work Especially if everything is so crowded And when all the three kids are growing up in poverty Especially there, think it's even more there You should do something with the space And then I knocked on the door and said Maybe you should do something with the space But what should we do? I just said I don't know But I think it's worth looking into And it's okay if you want to do it Okay, so that's how I started out And I had a contract I was paid by the company, for every company They paid me half-time I combined it with a half-time education as a teacher And the deal was you get a year And after the year you need to find funding To actually do it and then just go And then that's what happened What else am I going to open for? But it's actually a family business They have a huge space but it's a very small enterprise Because there's a slaughterhouse, there's a market They're facilitating everything But it's not them that are actually doing the slaughtering That are doing the selling And that's how it all starts And then I started telling people You know, use the space, use the space And I work with a private company I'm not going to trust you Because you're going to win something from me And I was like, oh my god, what am I going to do? And so instead of using the days when it was empty and selling people I said I have to find a way of interacting with the people while they're there I'll trust people And Friday said Sunday, on the markets There's all those people coming and they coming to my cheapest foods There is imbressels So they're all there So I thought I need to do something with foods And that's when the kitchen came in And then we started cooking By that time I didn't fill in an application For the Flamage government, for the two of the person who did my job before me And he was convinced, so he said, okay I'll give you three years to actually try and do this stuff And I could hire someone I didn't know, but it clicked and it was an architect And he has this mathematical brain And he can draw things, build things He wants to do something, not build bridges But really work with people So the two of us got together And I said I need mobile kitchens I said, okay, I'm going to build mobile kitchens Did you have space or just to understand Inside you have space for doing things I need to share enough with someone who worked in this little So the house thing But the house was basically just empty space The covered hall is empty for Monday until Thursday On Friday Saturday Sunday, it becomes a market It still is, yeah It's a market, okay Very early in the morning until 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, and evening Afternoon and then it disappears again And on Saturday it comes back It disappears again, Sunday even bigger And then it disappears again And the space for cultural heritage It's like a magnificent, it's incredibly beautiful And in that area having that amount of space that is also maintained It's clean, you know, and pretty safe That's just mind-blowing So that's the USP of the whole project And then as we started cooking on the markets Doing it in a very bad way People came up to us, so what are you doing On Friday making couscous and just pouring water over it Are you mad, you must be mental And then they started talking to us And we said, yeah, but you know we're here too Another day and maybe, you know, what can we do And it was always the same There was a lack of space And we went to our kids to be able to play That was always coming back And so we decided, okay, then we need to make a playground Another application Again, funding for that part And so, yeah, it's step by step And then we were cooking And then on Sunday we did There were people coming up to us People, when the last market dies There's a lot of food, you know, the on-salt food What to do with it? And if they leave it behind, they have to pay a fine So about what? If they take it with them, they'll probably just throw it out somewhere So with all those people that were incredibly hungry Or if they had food, it was not fresh fruit and vegetables So then people came up to us And we said, yeah, go ahead We're here, we'll facilitate it We're not going to do it But we're going to make sure that you have a space That you have a fridge, that you can And so then we started on Sundays After the market collecting fruit and vegetables Which was pretty amazing too Because on Monday we had fruit and vegetables too to cook with And so that too became Sunday collecting, Monday sharing and cooking There were so much, I kid you nuts between three and five tons every week I believe you I believe you And then on Monday we cook with it, use day two On Wednesday there's the big playgrounds In order to have something for the parents We created a pop-up restaurant We only use fruit and vegetables We never use meat or fish in order to For the food to be accessible for everyone So there's no discussion about halal, kosher or whatever No, it's just food for everyone And then there's the big playgrounds And on Friday when the market comes back We bring them out of mobile kitchens And there's a pedagogical food thing where classes subscribe And then they come and cook And it's cool because we've got these big tables and they cook But then the people from the market They come and sit and then we can talk again So everything evolves all the time And I just have a one question And you were the only conregionators with your friend I mean with your colleague I started it and after 12 months Yannik came in and Yannik made a huge difference It was made so much more powerful than it was And it was sounds like a lot of art There was an administrative First, wonderful woman that came to join us And we were three and now they're 10 But 10 and then an army of volunteers And those volunteers They're just, they're the real heart and the real Real power in the whole thing When did they come in? They started coming in from the start Because they didn't want to receive food They wanted to help to help And then they said, okay No, hold a spoon, help us cut stuff And then that's something Even those people that don't have anything Most, a lot of them are illegal Even though I don't believe people can be illegal You know, that's the status they've got They were the ones that wanted the status They wanted the ones being The ones that gave out food Rather than getting it They want to be useful We never used words give We always use words share Which is very important too And then the next step was Using all those tools Because just like the market We had to disappear too Everything we built is on wheels So nice But it was strong Because it's a huge space And there are trucks going everywhere So it had to be really, really strong So you had to disappear every day Every day? Every day? Now they convinced that they can The tables can stay from Monday to Thursday But still there's a lot of growing people Gather growing muscles Working that But then what made it even more interesting was When other organizations We had to transform the big play boxes And mobile kitchen to transportable ones So we built them So you can transport them by bike Everything is transportable by bike Because otherwise they always had to rent out a lorry Which is expensive So it was only a certain elite that could afford to use You ever see that? Yes So you can transport them by bike Everything is transportable by bike Do you ever see any of those stupid typical German issues Like sanitary controls Yeah FMI, their image You mean that 40,000 It's what you need to spend on the whole organization? No, no, no, no 40,000 is what the company gives to the NGO Every year Gave, I don't know what it is now Because with COVID They suffered quite some time So it really happened The organization which you started to talk about Which were hosted They started to come after the kitchen was So the kitchen was almost like at the core Of this organism And then organizations The baseline is a cultivated urban space The idea was Transform private space into public space That's always been the line Wherever it is But that was a base camp And it's where you can test out Experiment, try whatever it is Because it's still private space Which means you don't need to Ask for these Stupid commissions all the time From local government Yeah, and then you have to ask for 20, 30 days in advance And do all those security checks Which we've never had to do It is So everyone who enters private space It's their business Yeah, and that's what What changed my mind in a way Sometimes working with private partners Is so much easier And more functional Faster But also for the Public you're working with Is handier And they've got a long term vision But especially that Because governments They've got short-time vision Every four or five years It changes and then you have to see who's next And you have to talk to them And what kind of change you have to make For them to shine And it's not interesting And you have still public bodies So you still have I mean the pub, they all But now we It became a brand And nobody wants to go away So now If there is an application That we do, like, oh yeah We can fund them I don't know how long it's going to last Yeah, it's always a curve of organizations And the thing is as I jumped from one side to the other It's interesting to see how government works And how dating About funding and applications And it's cool because all those organizations that I know That are struggling I can change A little piece of the system Of the way you do your applications In order for organizations to Have access to funding In an easier way Because the language is Of all Is often different between organizations And administrations They need to see certain words And organizations write those words They don't necessarily do what it is they write And some can write easily And get funding all the time\n"
